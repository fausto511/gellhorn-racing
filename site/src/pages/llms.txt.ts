> Leonida Racing is an independent Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) racing database and community. The Garage covers GTA VI vehicles, classes, release information, first appearances, and real-life inspirations. Time Attack brings proof-based lap-time leaderboards to Gellhorn International Raceway. The Hub connects racers through crews and community events. Leonida Racing is not affiliated with Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive.

Status: GTA VI is scheduled for release on November 19, 2026. Leonida Racing is live before the game: current leaderboard entries, lap data, crews, and events marked as samples are demonstration content. GTA VI Time Attack is planned to accept real submissions from launch day, and its rules will be tested against the released game. Vehicles known only from unofficial pre-release material are marked "Not officially revealed" and excluded from search indexing. Users can already create crews and schedule community events in The Hub.
